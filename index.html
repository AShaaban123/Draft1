	<h3>Research of the Context of the Brief</h3>
	<p>The brief we received was about smart home automation. We were tasked with creating an embedded system that catered to the idea of a smart home, and designed a website for the owner of a fictitious smart home company. I did some research on different ways' technology has been used to make our home lives a bit more accessible and efficient. 
<br>
At first, I thought that smart home devices were only used to make life easier for those who can afford it, but it turns out that smart homes enable the most vulnerable in society to live in some comfort.  Smart home technology is capable of making daily tasks more manageable for the elderly and disabled. For example, an elderly person may not be able to stand for long periods of time or do some strenuous exercise, so a robot vacuum would be perfect as it automatically cleans up their house with little input from the owner.  Another example of smart home technology are smart lights. They allow for peace of mind & comfort as the people residing in the smart home can simply just schedule when to turn on/off the lights and can also control their lights via their mobile devices
<br>
Smart home technology has the ability to provide the elderly & the disabled with help to allow them to remain healthy and maintain conditions needed to live an independent lifestyle. 
<br>
The reliance of smart home devices in future homes will greatly improve the quality of life in comfort, safety, and efficiency, which provides an opportunity for people with disabilities to regain control over their life 
</p>

<h3>Response to the Brief</h3>
	<p>My first idea revolved around creating an alarm clock that would auto adjust to times of sunset/sunrise. As I hang around with multiple people who observe the month of Ramadan, in which they fast from sunset to sunrise, I thought they would be perfect end users for a smart alarm company, but I could not find any accurate minute perfect APIs. The only APIs that I could find were 20 minutes later than the real sunset/sunrise time. After doing some consulting, I decided to scrap the idea as it would not be useful to my end users with that big of a time difference.  <br>
I then began doing some market research on the needs of people and how to grow this fictitious smart home company. My 2nd idea was a temperature sensing smart fan, which turned out great. After doing some research into the brief and what was needed to be done it looked like a good idea. However, I couldnt go through with this due to hardware failures and long shipping times.
<br>
Finally for my 3rd idea, I decided to ask the elderly I personally know what they would like and what they're missing. An overwhelming majority of them said that they would like if they had a sensor in their homes that alerted them and their loved ones when it got too cold for their comfort and health.I concluded that a smart cold alarm would fit all the requirements of the brief. Smart lighting has a market share of $7.5 billion(2018), while smart temperature management only has a market share of $1.86 billion(2019). The decreased market share in smart temperature management allows the company to grow with less of a worry as there are fewer competitors. 
<h3>End users</h3>
<p>The end users of this project are people who have an increased risk of cold exposure. For example, elderly people, disabled people, and children</p>
