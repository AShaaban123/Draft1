<h3>Reflecting</h3>

  <p>Overall, I was pleased with how I responded to the brief and how much further interacting with the brief progressed my computer science skills. I thoroughly believe that I met all basic & advanced requirements requested of me by the brief. I feel especially proud about the website, as it was even more accessible and fleshed out than I had originally designed.
  <br>
  The embedded system works great as a standalone system with only the initial setup, and it functions properly with the site creating a 1 system smart device where you can monitor the device through the site. The site features 8 pages all related to the business owner's needs with multiple data capture points and validation checks. All pages were specifically designed in line with how an elderly person might look at things. Everything was concise and clear, with well-defined borders. Headers, lists, videos, etc, were also included to make everything more informative. I also made sure to comply with the school’s Acceptable Usage Policy and with GDPR. Multiple UI designs were also included to comply with the brief, same as everything else.
    <br>
  Our envisaged user needs were met perfectly with how accessibly the site became with dark mode turned on and with our consistent design throughout the entire site. Shneiderman's "Eight Golden Rules for interface design" was a great help, as it helped outline how beneficial being consistent with your layout is. 
<br>
In future iterations, I would  have data capture points directly link to a firebase database, allowing the business owner to learn more about what their customers require.
    <br>
Also, I would allow the control of what temperature limits the alarm sets off at using the site. This would allow for more customizability and would better suit a customer needs
